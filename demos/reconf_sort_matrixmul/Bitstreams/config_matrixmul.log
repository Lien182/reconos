Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (REQP-1839) RAMB36 async control check - The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_b_reg_10 has an input control pin design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_b_reg_10/ENARDEN (net: design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_B_reg[ram_we]__0) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_B_reg[ram_we]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
