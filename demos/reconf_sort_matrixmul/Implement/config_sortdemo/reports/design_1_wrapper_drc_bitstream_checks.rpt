PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/reconos_osif_intc_0/U0/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/s_axi_rvalid_i_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/reconos_osif_intc_0/U0/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/S_AXI_ARREADY_INST_0_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/reconos_osif_intc_0/U0/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/S_AXI_ARREADY_INST_0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_reg[ram_addr_n_0_][6]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_reg[ram_addr][6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

REQP-1839#99 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/slot_1/U0/local_ram_reg_1 has an input control pin design_1_i/slot_1/U0/local_ram_reg_1/ADDRBWRADDR[8] (net: design_1_i/slot_1/U0/o_RAMAddr_sorter[6]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/slot_1/U0/sorter_i/ptr_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
