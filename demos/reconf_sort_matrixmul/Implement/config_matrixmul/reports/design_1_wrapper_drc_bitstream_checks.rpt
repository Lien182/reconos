DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/slot_0/U0/matrixmultiplier_i/multOp__0 output design_1_i/slot_0/U0/matrixmultiplier_i/multOp__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/slot_1/U0/matrixmultiplier_i/multOp__0 output design_1_i/slot_1/U0/matrixmultiplier_i/multOp__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

DSP design_1_i/slot_0/U0/matrixmultiplier_i/multOp multiplier stage design_1_i/slot_0/U0/matrixmultiplier_i/multOp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/reconos_osif_intc_0/U0/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/s_axi_rvalid_i_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/reconos_osif_intc_0/U0/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/S_AXI_ARREADY_INST_0_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/reconos_osif_intc_0/U0/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/S_AXI_ARREADY_INST_0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_b_reg_10 has an input control pin design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_b_reg_10/ENARDEN (net: design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_B_reg[ram_we]__0) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_B_reg[ram_we]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/slot_1/U0/local_ram_c_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/slot_1/U0/local_ram_c_reg/ADDRARDADDR[5] (net: design_1_i/slot_1/U0/o_ram_C_reg[ram_addr]_rep[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/slot_1/U0/o_ram_C_reg[ram_addr]_rep[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
