WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (REQP-1839) RAMB36 async control check - The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_b_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/slot_0/U0/local_ram_b_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_B_reg[ram_addr_n_0_][9]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/slot_0/U0/o_ram_B_reg[ram_addr][9]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
